This directory is for needed extra data files.

Examples include opacity tables or tables of UV background radiation.

rosseland.abpoll.p3p5.amax1.dat: Rosseland mean opacity table from D'Alessio
                                 et al, 2001, as described in Boley et al, 2010.
                                 This assumes a 1 micron maximum grain size
                                 and a power law grain size distribution with
                                 index -3.5.
                                 This is an ASCII table, one entry per line,
                                 covering 100 values of pressure,
                                 logarithmically spaced between -12.0 and 9.0
                                 (log10(cgs units)), and 100 values of
                                 temperature between 0.5 and 7.0
                                 (log10(Kelvin)). See cooling_boley.c for how
                                 this is read in.
planck.abpoll.p3p5.amax1.dat: Same as above, but with Planck mean opacities.

mri.director: an example director file to create an MRI of a cosmological
volume.

lwtables.txt: A (non-regular!) grid of masses (rows, in Msol)  and times (cols, in yr), giving the LW flux (in photons/sec) for each mass/age of the star.
Used for stochastic IMF, which includes individual high mass stars. Values derived using starburst99, restricting the lmax/lmin
parameters to just one single stellar mass. The mass values are 8-39 in intervals of 1, and 41-99 in intervals of 2. The times are
1.0e4-9.801e7 in intervals of 2.e6. The first line gives nrow and ncol, respectively.
