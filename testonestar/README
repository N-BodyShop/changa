This directory contains tests of the feedback and associated stellar
evolution.  The test simulation is a single star (actually stellar population)
in a cloud of gas, that is run for 13 Gyr. 

run.sh shows the basic script to run the test with ChaNGa. "metalcheck.sh"
extracts needed information into a number of files and then runs an IDL
script to perform the check.

"metals.awk" and "energy.awk" are other helper scripts to do checks on the
output.

Makefile also can build a standalone test for supernovaia that shows
overall supernova output based on the modules used in ChaNGa.
