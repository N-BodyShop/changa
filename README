To compile ChaNGa first compile Charm++ or get a precompiled version.  When
building Charm++, there is a special target "ChaNGa" which will build all the
necessary libraries.  Then to compile ChaNGa itself, run:

./configure
make (or gmake)

The executable ChaNGa will be created together with the submit script charmrun
(for most machines).  Configure takes the usual options and also the
"--enable-cooling" option to specify cooling for gas simulations.

To run the code:

./charmrun +p <procs> ChaNGa <param.file> [ additional options ]

This will work on many machines, and can either be run directly or be
submitted through the local scheduler.  However, on some machines the
application will need to be submitted manually.

Several test simulations are included in subdirectories:

A small globular cluster simulation is included in teststep.  This
simulation can give a quick sanity check that the gravity code is
operating correctly.

A small cosmological simulation is included in testcosmo.

A small shock tube (gas only) simulation is included in testshock.

A small gas collapse simulation is included in testcollapse.

For simple performance benchmarking, arbitrary size simulations can be created
using the tools in testdata.

An example simulation that generates movie frames is included in movie.  See
the director.README in that directory for movie-making options.
