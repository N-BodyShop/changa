1) YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY THE FILE 'mf.sh' TO RUN THIS TEST
   - Replace 'skiddir' with the path to your working version of skid
   - Replace 'sodir' with the path to your working version of SO
SKID and SO can be downloaded from ftp://ftp-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/pub/hpcc.

2) THIS TEST CALLS ON AN IDL PROGRAM TO RUN

3) Type "run.sh" to run the test using ChaNGa.  The test is a
simulation of an Omega = 0.3, Lambda = 0.7, h = 0.7 LCDM concordance
cosmology large volume with 48^3 particles and 300 Mpc on a side.  You
may need to add parameters or a nodelist file to run this in parallel.
See the CHARM installation and users manual at
http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/manuals/html/install/manual.html.  The run
takes 15 minutes to run on a 2007 era dual core processor.

4) After running ChaNGa and making the modifications in 1, type
"mf.sh" at the prompt to check the results.  It runs SKID and SO on
the results, and then calls a python script (mf2.py) to compare the
resulting mass function to the expected mass function.

  - If the mass function matches that expected, a congratulatory statement is 
    sent to the screen
  - If the mass function varies from that expected by more than 5% at any 
    given mass, a warning is directed to the screen.  Information on the 
    deviating points is printed to the screen.  A plot showing the expected 
    mass function and the produced mass function is created, called 'test.ps'.

4) To remove the files produced by the test, type 'clean.sh'

NOTE: The mass function that the script uses for comparison was previously 
generated using PKDGRAV, and compared to Press-Schecter theory to be certain 
that the simulation got reasonable results.
