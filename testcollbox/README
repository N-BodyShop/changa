This directory contains a test of the collision module. A collection of
solid spheres are placed in a periodic box with random positions, random
velocity vector orientations and uniform speeds. The particles are allowed
to elastically bounce off of each other. After a sufficient number of steps,
the speeds should follow a Maxwell-Bolztmann distribution.

The command './runtest.sh' will run the test simulation and verify the results.
The script used to generate the initial conditions is also included, and can
be run using 'python genIC.py'.
