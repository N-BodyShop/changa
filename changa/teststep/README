This is a simple test of the time integrator, as well as the potential
solver.  The test involves a "King model", a reasonable model for a
globular cluster.  The model is integrated for 10 "big" steps of .1
each, which is approximately the dynamical time in the center for the
cluster.  The test takes about 4 minutes to run on a dual core 2007 era
Intel processor.

The test criteria is that the energy is conserved reasonably well.
This numnber is in the third column at the end of pgtest.log.  It
should be conserved to 4 decimal places.  The comparision is made
against "pkdtest.log" which was produced by PKDGRAV using the same
initial conditions and the test_pkd.param parameter file.

"make test" will run the test.
