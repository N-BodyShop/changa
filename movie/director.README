This directory contains example "director" and param files for making movies
with ChaNGa.  Below is an explanation of the parameters.

dDumpFrameTime       timestep of dumps
Command line  +dft dt
dDumpFrameStep       step number of dumps
Command line  +dfi dstep

If trying to do a single output time fly around use a very small dDumpFrameTime, e.g.:
bDoGravity = 0   (optional)
dDumpFrameTime = 1e-6
Where 1e-6 is much smaller than any time scale in the simulation

Frame camera parameters are interpolated using 4 points (2 either side
of the exact frame time) if available.  Otherwise as many points as are available
are used down to simple linear interpolation.  Not all parameters
are amenable to interpolation.

e.g. Image size is not interpolated

If a parameter is not interpolated it just changes to the new value
when the frame time equals or passes the time point.

Time points for camera parameters are specified in the director file.
Each time the keyword "time" is specific a new point is created
and each parameter changed after than point refers to that time.

You must specify a first time point before the start of the simulation
to interpolate smoothly.

  This is simulation time

target x y z
  target point for view
  default: 0 0 0

physical
  Frame is rendered in physical (as opposed to comoving) co-ordinates.

eye rel|abs
  rel means the eye is positioned relative to the target point (default)
  abs means the eye is positioned in absolute coordinates

eye1 x y z 
OR
eye x y z 
  eye point (camera position)
  Technically is is eye1 (but eye2 defaults to zero) so by default this sets the fully
  camera position.
  Saying "eye" or "eye1" is equivalent.
  The magnitude of this vector can be renormalized to zeye1 (if non-zero)
  The TOTAL magnitude of the eye vector (eye+eye2) is renormalized to zeye (if non-zero)
  default: 0 0 -.5

eye2 x y z
  secondary eye vector -- added to the first eye position (eye1)
  Can be useful for complicated camera trajectories
  The magnitude of this vector can be renormalized to zeye2 (if non-zero)
  The TOTAL magnitude of the eye vector (eye1+eye2) is renormalized to zeye (if non-zero)
  default: 0 0 0

up x y z
  up direction for screen
  default: 0 1 0

size nx ny
  size of image
  default: 800 600

zeye x
  how far away the camera is from target
  the eye position is just used to determine a vector direction in this case
  applied to total camera vector (eye1+eye2)
  default: 0 (OFF)

zeye1 x
  constraint on distance to camera
  applied to first part of total camera vector (eye1)
  default: 0 (OFF)

zeye2 x
  constraint on distance to camera
  applied to second part of total camera vector (eye2)
  default: 0 (OFF)

FOV x
  width of the viewing area in degrees (e.g. 60-90)
  Larger fields of view tend to enhance the perspective effects
  Fields of view larger than 120 may result in very distorted images
  default: 90

loop t0 dt
  starts looping in time at t0 with a period dt
  So at t0+dt it starts repeat the directions for t0

  default: 0.01 2.0

SCALING OF COLUMN DENSITIES TO PIXEL VALUES

By default the scaling is linear for small column densities (< 10.) but
then flattens out to prevent over-saturation.  Key words for other scalings
are:

logscale logmin logmax
  set scaling for colours from the projected column densities
  converts input colors to final colours.
  logmin is the column density that maps to "0" pixel value
  logmax is the column density that maps to the saturated pixel value.
  default: OFF

logscalecoloursafe logmin logmax
  similar to logscale except that saturation does not change the hue
  of a pixel.  E.g. the ratio of r,g,b values will not change due
  to saturation.
  logmin is the column density that maps to "0" pixel value
  logmax is the column density that maps to the saturated pixel value.
  default: OFF

ADJUSTING DUMPFRAME PARAMETERS

The dumpframe framework prints out some diagnostics that will be helpful
in adjusting your frames.  Following is an example:

DF Projection: 1280 x 720 FOV 30.000000  width 0.696668 height 0.391876

"width" and "height" give you the size of your image in simulation units.
If "physical" is specified in the director file and this is a comoving
simulation, then these will be multiplied by (1 + z).

DF eye -0.010000 0.000000 0.000000, target 0.076597 0.056969 -0.123637, (separat
ion 1.300000)

"eye" and "target" should be as specified in the director file.
"separation" is the distance between eye and target, again, multiplied by
(1 + z) for physical in a comoving simulation.

DF up 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000  Z-Clipping: Near 1.040000 Far 1.560000
DF Vectors: x 0.000000 1194.256258 0.000000, y 0.000000 0.000000 1194.256258 z 1
.000000 0.000000 0.000000
DF Colours: 
DF dark density 0.000000 1.000000
DF dark 0.000000 10.000000 10.000000 20.000000 
DF image range: 0 to 1.04136e-05

The "image range" numbers give the minimum and maximum pixel values.
If the "logscale" option is used, these numbers are before the scaling
is applied.  Hence in the above example "logscale 1e-10 1e-5" would
produce an image that just hits saturation and has 5 orders of magnitude
in column density.
