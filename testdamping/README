This folder contains a simple test to verify that the damping force is
correctly working.

The initial conditions are just the ChaNGa spherical collapse test, but with
all particles given a large velocity in the z direction (of order the length
scale of the simulation divided by the time scale).  The mean particle 
velocities are expected to remain 0 along the x and y directions and the
mean z-velocity should damp exponentially with an inverse timescale given
by the dGlassDamper runtime parameter.  That is to say, we expect:

    vz = vz0 * exp(-t * dGlassDamper)
    
The simulation runs for 3 damping times. The simulation can be run simply as:

    ../ChaNGa sphere.param

After running, the simulation can be analyzed with analyzedamping.py by
executing it:

    ./analyzedamping.py
    
This analysis requires diskpy (https://github.com/ibackus/diskpy), but 
basically all it does is verify that the mean z velocity correctly damps.

Different damping timescales can be tested just by changing the dGlassDamper
parameter or other params in the .param file.  The analysis will handle this.
