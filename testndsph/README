This folder contains a few tests for NDSPH. 

To configure for a given number of dimensions, do:
    ./configure --enable-ndsph=2
    make clean
    make
In the ChaNGa directory

You can cleanup generated files by running:
    ./cleanup

************************************
Density test
************************************
This is a basic test to verify that the various ND-kernels are giving the
correct density estimates.  The snapshots here are an N-Dimensional cube
(line, plane, or cube) in a periodic box length 1 with a density of 1.  The
test runs the ICs for 0-steps and verifies that the calculated density is
correct.

Run the test by typing cd'ing into this directory and calling:

    ./densitytest ndim
    
Where ndim is the number of dimensions (1, 2, or 3)

Files for these tests are in the directories density_*d/.  You can vary runtime
parameters by editing the .param files in the folders.

************************************
Acceleration test
************************************
This is a basic test to verify the kernel gradients are giving the correct 
density gradient estimates.  The ICs are the gridded, N-dimensional cubes
of the density test with a gaussian density perturbation applied by changing
the particle mass.  The test runs the ICs for zero time-steps and verifies that
the calculated particle accelerations are correct.  

This test generates a profile plot of acceleration vs. position.  NOTE: the
"predicted" and the "actual" accleration profiles may differ, especially in 
the 3D test where the effective resolution is lower.  As long as the overall
shape is close, the test is a success.  Differences of more than about 10% 
indicate an issue.

Run the test by typing cd'ing into this directory and calling:

    ./acctest ndim
    
Where ndim is the number of dimensions (1, 2, or 3)
